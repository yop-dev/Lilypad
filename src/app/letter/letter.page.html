      Prelude
        <p>
          It is currently a rainy afternoon, I currently am looking and writing in front of my laptop with no internet, no music, just my thoughts. As I write this introduction, I look back and think about what kind of person I was before meeting the love of my life, and that is you, Ally. as I gather my thoughts, I realized how much I have changed since I first laid eyes on you inside of that book store we first met. I have always been a timid, shy person ever since childhood, scared of trying things out on my own, I always wanted someone to be by my side as I try and explore and expand my horizons, someone that will motivate me, to tell me I am doing great, that I should keep going, and that they are proud of me, because the thing is, as I always have been the smart kid growing up, I was rarely complimented on my achievements, so for the longest time, I have waited, and waited, for someone to come in and put my worries aside and to walk with me towards the path I want to take. And I am so glad that you came, my Ally, because with you, I am confident, you're one of the reasons why I strive to become a better version of myself each and every day.

          Meeting you the first time was such a pleasure, meeting you the second time gave me butterflies, the third time was such fun, and meeting you each time makes me feel such joy and love.

      Chapter 1: First Date
        <p>
          It was the 12th of November, year 2022. Though having so much doubt, I really wanted to see the person that consistently tries to keep me happy through her constant messaging. It was such a long, tiring commute, but thinking about finally meeting you made me smile as I look through the bus windows imagining scenarios on how our first date would go, different kind of emotions came pouring in, "Am I really ready for this?", "Will she like my bald head?". But eventually, all those worries ended when I we had our first conversation, meeting you felt so natural; the coffee was nice, your hair looked flawless, your outfit was gorgeous, but most of all, your eyes, it has captured mine, those beautiful, round eyes of yours, I just love staring at them.

      Chapter 2: First Kiss
        <p>
          We made it official the night of the 15th November, 2022. You're mine, and I am yours. Such joy I felt that time, I, for the first time in my life actually have someone to be by my side at all times. I couldn't wait to meet you again. Thankfully, almost a month after I first met you, we finally had the time to go and see each other, I couldn't be happier.
